# Piezo_Test_Results
Compare Piezo Impedance results from HP vector analyzer vs Zurich Instrument lockIn vs LTSpice 

Measured the impedance of a small piezo stack from PI(https://www.physikinstrumente.store/us/pl033.31/ ) with Vector analyzer and ZI lockin, then simulated the results with LTSpice

The LTSpice model is referred to https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/19446
